Arts vs. Sciences. 
People says you are an Arts Tech person, you like anything considered “art”, you’re an artist and shouldn’t do science-y things, like computers. The logic here is horrible.

Extrovert vs. Introvert. 
If you talk a lot, you’re an extrovert, and if you’re an extrovert, you should get a career working with people, not computers. Again, It is horrible. Just wrong in so many ways.
